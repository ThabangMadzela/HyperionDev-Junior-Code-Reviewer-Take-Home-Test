# Review of "anagram.py"

## Correctness

    The code logic looks correct, but the function groupAnagrams
    does not return the expected output for the provided input.
    On line 4, in the sorted() function, you did not specify 
    the parameter to sort. This will cause a TypeError. It 
    should be sorted(i). Please fix this error.

## Efficiency
    Your code seems to be efficient as it runs in O(nlogn) time 
    complexity where n is the length of the input list. Futhermore, 
    since the sorting operation on each string in the list which 
    takes O(klogk) time complexity where k is the maximum length 
    of the string in the list. Therefore, the overall time complexity 
    of the code is O(nklogk).

> However, as the sorting operation is performed using Python's built-in sorted()function, it is relatively efficient, and the overall time complexity is reasonable.

## Style
    Your code seems to follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code, which 
    is a widely accepted standard for writing Python code. The code has 
    consistent indentation using 4 spaces per level, but no clear or 
    descriptive variable names. In addition, the code could be made 
    more readable by adding comments or docstrings to explain the 
    function's purpose and inputs.

## Documentation

    The code lacks documentation. There is no explanation of the 
    function's purpose, inputs, or outputs. Adding a docstring to 
    the groupAnagrams function would make it easier for others to 
    understand the code's intent.

## Suggestions for Improvement
> * Specify the parameter to sort on line 4.
> * Add a docstring to the groupAnagrams function to explain its purpose, inputs, and outputs.
> * Add comments to the code to explain the sorting operation and the use of a dictionary to group anagrams.

> ### Overall, the code has a clear and easy-to-read style, which makes it easy to understand and modify if needed.
